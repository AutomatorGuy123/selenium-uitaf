# Minimalistic selenium based UI testing framework with page-component open source project and Allure reporting.

* UITAF (UI Test Automation Framework) is another attempt to make life of automation developers easier by providing concise test automation development approach with automatic generation of test data-sets from page-objects and generation of detailed report at the end of the test execution. 

* The UITAF uses new approach for business oriented testing by introducing new design pattern called “domain-objects” where multiple web pages are involved across single business scenario.  

* UITAF supports concurrency right out of the box by invoking multiple test cases using multiple supported browsers on the single machine, on the selenium grid or on Virtual Machines in the cloud.  

* UITAF seamlessly integrates with continuous integration systems allowing easy configuration for running the tests jobs against multiple environments, it also has capability to embed test report with any job run by hosting the report on the CI server.
